# Canvas Scripts
A collection of Canvas scripts that help me out.


## Want to do peer evaluations in your class?
* Use the getStudentGroups.py script to get the groups and their members.
* Take the CSV file and put it into a Google Sheet.
* Use createStudentEvaluationForm.js in Google's AppScript enviornment to generate a Google Form.
